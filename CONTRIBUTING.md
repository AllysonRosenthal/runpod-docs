# Contribution Guide for RunPod Documentation

We warmly welcome contributions to the RunPod project.
Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, your help is greatly appreciated. This guide will help you get started with contributing to the RunPod project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the RunPod repository to your GitHub account. This creates a personal copy for you to work on.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using `git clone`. This will allow you to make changes to the codebase.

## Making Contributions

1. **Create a New Branch**: Always create a new branch for your work. This keeps your contributions organized and separated from the main branch. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature-add-xyz` or `bugfix-issue-123`.

2. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes or improvements in your branch. Be sure to follow the project's coding standards and guidelines.

3. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages. This helps others understand what changes you've made and why.

4. **Sync with Main Branch**: Regularly sync your branch with the main branch of the original repository to stay updated with any changes and avoid conflicts.

## Submitting Your Contributions

1. **Test Your Changes**: Before submitting, ensure your changes do not introduce any bugs or issues. Run any tests if available.

2. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Once your changes are ready and tested, push your branch to your fork and create a pull request to the main RunPod repository. Provide a clear description of your changes and the purpose of the PR.

3. **Code Review**: Wait for the project maintainers to review your PR. Be open to feedback and make any required revisions.

4. **Merge**: Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the main codebase.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Follow Project Conventions**: Adhere to the coding, commenting, and formatting conventions used in the project.
- **Respectful Communication**: Always communicate respectfully with other contributors and maintainers.
- **Report Issues**: If you find bugs or have feature requests, open an issue in the repository.
